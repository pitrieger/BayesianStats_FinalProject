# BaysianStats_FinalProject

This repo includes the replication files of the final project for the course Applied Bayesian Statistics. In the paper, I replicate the analysis of a paper by [Krauss & Kroeber (2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13501763.2020.1773905) who show that government stability is higher in cabinets with a higher share of female ministers. I transfer their survival model to an exponential survival model which I implement in `Stan`.
