# Stan model
Survival models are still often associated with a frequentist approach. Certainly easy to use \texttt{R}-packages, such as \texttt{Survival} [CITE] have played a role in their popularity. At the same time, \texttt{rstanarm} [CITE] has only recently started adding survival models to the development version\footnote{\url{https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm/tree/feature/survival} (retrieved on 11 May 2021)}. Instead of relying on this à-la-carte option, I wrote the \texttt{Stan} code myself. However, Eren M. Elçi's blog post\footnote{\url{https://ermeel86.github.io/case_studies/surv_stan_example.html} (retrieved on 11 May 2021)} on Bayesian survival models was incredibly helpful to vectorize the posterior draws using \texttt{Stan}'s convenient logarithmic complementary cumulative distribution function (\texttt{*\_lccdf}).
